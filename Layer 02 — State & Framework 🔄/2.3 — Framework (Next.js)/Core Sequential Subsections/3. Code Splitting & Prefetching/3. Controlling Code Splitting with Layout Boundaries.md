3. Controlling Code Splitting with Layout Boundaries

Each layout in `/app` defines a new code-splitting boundary.

Example Directory:
/app
├── layout.tsx
├── page.tsx
├── about/layout.tsx
├── about/page.tsx

└──
contact/page.tsx

Behavior:
- The root layout (`/app/layout.tsx`) is persistent and shared across all routes.
- Components imported here are bundled once and stay mounted between navigations.
- Each nested layout adds an additional split boundary specific to its subtree.

Navigation Flow:
- Visiting `/` loads root layout + home page chunk.
- Navigating to `/about` loads `/about`’s layout + page chunk.
- Shared layout remains mounted; only route-specific deltas load.

Shared layouts = larger initial bundle but faster route transitions.
