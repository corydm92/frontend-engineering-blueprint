# Docs Reference Map

## Purpose

Point writers to the best in-repo examples for each document type and section shape.
Use this file as the starting point when adding new docs so structure stays consistent.

## How to use this map

- Start with the structure reference for the doc type you’re writing.
- Use the content reference to match tone and section flow.
- Reuse formatting patterns before adding content.
- If you create a stronger example, replace the content reference here.
