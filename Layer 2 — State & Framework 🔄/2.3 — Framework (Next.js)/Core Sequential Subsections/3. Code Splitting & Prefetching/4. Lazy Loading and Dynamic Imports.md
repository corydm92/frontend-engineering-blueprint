4. Lazy Loading and Dynamic Imports

For non-route-level code, use `dynamic()` to create manual split points.

Example:
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const Chart = dynamic(() => import('../components/Chart'), {
loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
ssr: false,
});

Behavior:
- `Chart` is compiled into its own chunk.
- ItÍs fetched only when rendered on the client.
- While loading, the fallback component appears.
- If `ssr: false`, the chunk is excluded from server render.

Dynamic imports reduce the main bundle size and delay loading of rarely used components.
