0. Subsection Summary

Next.js determines how and when your applicationÍs UI is rendered „ either at build time, on demand, or incrementally.

Rendering begins with route classification: whether a route can be fully prebuilt, partially generated, or must render dynamically at request time.

This classification drives the data-fetching behavior, build pipeline, serialization, caching, and client hydration strategy.

The goal: deliver the fastest possible render path for each route while maintaining consistency between build-time and runtime behavior.

1. Static vs Dynamic Routes
Defines route classification rules; the entry point for understanding render type decisions.

2. Route Classification and Data Fetching Behavior
Explains how Next.js decides between static, dynamic, and streaming render paths based on data hooks.

3. Static Route Build Process „ HTML and RSC Generation
Shows what happens at build time after classification.

4. RSC Payload Serialization & Flight Transport
Details how React Server Components are serialized into the Flight payload and streamed to the client.

5. Rendering Modes „ Static, ISR, and Dynamic
Summarizes render types from both build-time and runtime angles.

6. Caching Model „ Data, Route, and CDN Layers
Describes how rendered outputs are stored and reused to reduce redundant rendering.

7. Hydration and Reconciliation Entry
Covers how React rebuilds the virtual tree on the client and attaches interactivity to the cached HTML.
