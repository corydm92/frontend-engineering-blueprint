Documentation Best-Practice Hierarchy

1. **README.md** ? What this project is and how to run it. <ETH> (effective README structure examples GitHub)
2. **ARCHITECTURE.md** ? How the system is structured and *why* itÍs designed that way. <ETH> (software architecture documentation guide)
3. **CONTRIBUTING.md** ? How to build, test, and deploy safely. <ETH> (open source contributing guide format)
4. **CHANGELOG.md** ? What changed and when, using semantic versioning. <ETH> (keep a changelog format)
5. **In-Code Comments** ? Explain *why* something exists when not self-evident. <ETH> (when to comment code best practices)

> **Rule:** Documentation should lower cognitive load, not add it.
When it takes longer to understand *the docs* than *the code*, the docs have failed.
