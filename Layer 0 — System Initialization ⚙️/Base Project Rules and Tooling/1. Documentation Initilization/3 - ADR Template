## Purpose
Define the canonical ADR template used to document architectural and foundational decisions. The template is the enforcement mechanism for decision-making: changes to tooling, architecture, or foundation behavior must be explicit, reviewable, and historically traceable. This template is created before any ADRs exist so every decision follows the same structure from day one.

The Project Stack Summary (Step 2) documents what’s currently true. ADRs document how truth changes and why, so decisions don’t drift into Slack, PR comments, or commit messages. This step produces exactly one artifact (the ADR template) and nothing else—no decisions, no tool choices. ADRs are required for foundational changes (framework, language/runtime, build, state/data, testing strategy, security/auth) and are not required for routine refactors or patch bumps. ADRs are immutable once accepted; changes require a new ADR that explicitly supersedes the prior one, and status must be Proposed, Accepted, or Superseded.
