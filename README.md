# 📘 Frontend Engineering Blueprint

The patterns in this blueprint come from recurring problems I’ve had to solve in production React systems: migrations, performance regressions, unclear ownership boundaries, and scaling team workflows. Examples are generalized to avoid proprietary details.

This repo documents my **Frontend Engineering Blueprint System** — a 7-layer architectural model for building and operating frontend applications, where each layer builds on the last, making correctness and stability the default across the SDLC.

> ⭐ If this blueprint is useful to you, consider starring the repo.
>
> It helps signal that long-form, systems-level frontend documentation is worth maintaining and evolving.

## 🧭 What this represents

- How I reason about frontend correctness, scale, and team alignment
- How I break complex frontend systems into ordered, enforceable layers
- How I design documentation that scales with teams, not against them

This is the framework I use when I’m responsible for long-lived systems — not one-off features.

## 🚀 Where to start

Start with this README, then pick a Blueprint Guide (template) based on what you want:

- **Public Edition** — high-level overview
- **Team Edition** — practical default for team adoption
- **Master Edition** — full reference: contracts, patterns, edge cases

## 📚 Blueprint Project Guide Templates

Projects copy one template into their repo as `Blueprint Project Guide.md` and edit it.

This repo includes three guide templates, each serving a different audience:

🧠 **Master Edition**

The complete, opinionated reference — dense, detailed, and system-level.

This is my personal go-to copy. Each project gets its own Master copy (built using the Layer 0 setup flow) because every project has different needs.

When conventions overlap, I pull from this Master into the project copy. When a project offers something new (new language, new constraint, new pattern), I define it in the project first, then upstream it back into this Master once it proves out.

🧰 **Team Edition**

A shorter, practical guide designed for team adoption and governance.

This is the recommended starting point for most real projects.  
Teams copy this into their repo as the **Blueprint Project Guide** and edit it to fit their context.

🌐 **Public Edition**

A readable overview intended for sharing concepts without internal depth.

This is for a general audience and explains the Blueprint without going deep into implementation details.

## 🗂 What’s in this repo

The Guides are the starting templates; the Blueprint System is the expanded project knowledge base that lives under `/docs/blueprint`.

The Blueprint System is organized into seven layers, each representing a stage in the frontend lifecycle:

- **Layer 0 — System Initialization**
- **Layer 1 — Language & Architecture**
- **Layer 2 — State & Framework**
- **Layer 3 — Quality & Stability**
- **Layer 4 — UI & Experience**
- **Layer 5 — Build & Delivery**
- **Layer 6 — Security & Observability**

Each layer contains multiple sections, and every section follows the same internal structure:

- **Base Project Rules and Tooling**  
  Hard rules, setup contracts, ADRs, and configuration baselines.

- **Core Sequential Subsections**  
  An ordered mental model explaining how the system works, step-by-step.

- **Supporting Atomic Notes**  
  Focused deep dives, edge cases, and reference material that support the core model.

This structure is deliberate.  
It prevents documentation drift, enforces clarity, and keeps knowledge scalable as systems and teams grow.

## 🧩 Blueprint Project Guide vs Blueprint System

The **Blueprint Project Guide** is the starting point — the project’s top-level blueprint document (intent + standards).

It defines:

- project goals
- core engineering principles
- what “good” looks like in this repo
- what standards matter and why

Then the **Blueprint System** is built from that guide.

It’s the structured documentation implementation where those goals and standards get expanded into:

- layer rules and section contracts
- setup + enforcement paths
- deeper learning + reference notes that support the rules

In short:

- **Blueprint Project Guide** = intent + standards (source document)
- **Blueprint System** = the implementation of that intent (expanded structure + artifacts)

## 🧪 Status

Active and evolving.

The Blueprint System is continuously refined as it’s validated against real-world frontend systems, team constraints, and production failures.
