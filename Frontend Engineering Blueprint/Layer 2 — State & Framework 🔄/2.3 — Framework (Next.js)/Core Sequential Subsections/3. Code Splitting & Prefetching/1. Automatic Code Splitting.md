1. Automatic Code Splitting

In a traditional SPA, the browser downloads all JS at once.
Next.js divides your application by route segments, producing isolated bundles per page or layout.

Example Directory:
/app
??? page.tsx
??? about/page.tsx
??? contact/page.tsx

At build time:
- Each route compiles to a separate JS chunk.
- Visiting `/` loads only the root layout and page chunk.
- Navigating to `/about` or `/contact` triggers loading of those route-specific chunks.
- Shared layouts or components persist in a shared parent bundle.

This prevents unrelated routes from blocking initial render and isolates runtime errors per page.
