Shared Contract Models Ñ Examples by System Type

?

? Same-Language Monorepo (e.g., TypeScript full-stack with tRPC or Next.js API)

Goal: zero drift between client and server Ñ one type system, one runtime.

Pattern:
¥ Define contracts directly in code (/packages/api or /contracts workspace).
¥ Export type definitions or procedures that both front- and backend import.
¥ Use tRPC / Zod / TypeBox for schema + runtime validation.
¥ CI enforces shared build Ñ any breaking change fails dependent builds.

Example structure:

/packages
/contracts
index.ts // shared Zod schemas + types
/frontend
/backend

Result: full type inference; no serialization mismatch.
Trade-off: tightly coupled Ñ upgrades ripple instantly through all packages.

?

? Different-Language Monorepo (e.g., Java + TypeScript in one repo)

Goal: maintain language autonomy but shared contract source.

Pattern:
¥ Keep schema in a neutral format (OpenAPI YAML, GraphQL SDL, Protobuf).
¥ Generate language-specific clients in CI.
¥ Commit generated clients under /generated or build on-demand.
¥ Use schema-linting + diff-tools to detect drift (spectral, graphql-inspector).

Example structure:

/contracts
openapi.yaml
/backend-java
src/main/java/... // generates models via openapi-generator
/frontend-ts
/generated // types from openapi-typescript

Result: consistent API across languages; one schema as the truth.
Trade-off: slower iteration Ñ schema change ? regen ? rebuild both sides.

?

?? Same-Language Microservices (e.g., multiple Node services + TS frontend)

Goal: enforce consistency without central monolith.

Pattern:
¥ Publish shared contract package to internal registry (@org/contracts).
¥ Version semantically; dependent services pin to version.
¥ Changes require bump + changelog.
¥ CI verifies consumer services use compatible contract versions.

Example:

npm publish @org/contracts@1.2.0
frontend ? ^1.2.0
orders-service ? ^1.2.0

Result: modular but type-safe network.
Trade-off: version churn Ñ consumers must upgrade intentionally.

?

? Different-Language Microservices (e.g., Java API ? TypeScript frontend ? Python analytics)

Goal: language-agnostic interoperability.

Pattern:
¥ Define schema once (OpenAPI, GraphQL, or gRPC Protobuf).
¥ Store it in a central ÒAPI-contractsÓ repo.
¥ Each service generates its stubs/types during build.
¥ CI enforces backward compatibility via schema diff checks.

Example:

/api-contracts
graphql/
schema.graphql
fragments/
openapi/
v1.yaml

Tooling: graphql-codegen, openapi-generator, buf (for gRPC).

Result: fully decoupled polyglot system with strict interface governance.
Trade-off: extra pipeline complexity Ñ contracts behave like versioned APIs, not inline types.

Summary

Scenario Contract Medium Type Safety Coupling Typical Tools
Same-Lang Monorepo In-code (Zod/tRPC) Direct inference Tight tRPC, Zod
Diff-Lang Monorepo Schema file + codegen Generated Moderate OpenAPI, GraphQL
Same-Lang Microservice Published package Strong Moderate npm pkg + CI gates
Diff-Lang Microservice Schema repo + codegen Generated Loose OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC
